It solves the issue of me having no initial work experience or preparation for the IT industry, by delivering: 1) CompTIA A+ Certification; 2) personal website coded in HTML documenting my findings and relevance for other students; 3) database of professional network and contacts and relevant insights; 4) a report on specific utilized resources and relevance to beginning IT candidates; and 5) an interactive activity to summarize knowledge and apply knowledge gained. Myself and other students will benefit from this, since this will provide key insights and real hands-on understanding of current status of the IT industry we will enter.</p>

                        <h4>Personal Mission Connection:</h4>
                        <p>My personal mission, as of now, is to obtain my first work experience and succeed at that work. This project connects to that mission, because it reflects and hones values necessary to obtain and succeed at that work, such as: 1) Diligence; 2) Organization; 3) Proactivity; and 4) Thoughtfulness. This project requires diligence to ensure all the steps are met within specific constraints presented, as would be the case in work. This project requires organization to ensure clear understanding of objectives and no unnecessary confusion and waste of resources, as would be the case in work. It also requires proactivity to ensure timeliness and compliance with any and all existing standards and addressing of unexpected issues, as would be done at work. Finally, it requires thoughtfulness to ensure that it is original, valuable beyond its basic presentation and content, and something that is authentically me or representative of my personal thoughts and ideas, as would be the case in work.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Vision Alignment:</h4>
                        <p>My vision is to become a respected leader in data management and enterprise resource planning known for my adaptable, scalable, and effective solutions, as well as emphasis on excellent relationships with clients and customers and being current with latest systems developments. This project will help me to achieve that by serving as an initial front-door entryway to establish a strong foothold in my vision's required areas of: 1) professional outreach and communications; 2) technical understanding; 3) technical application and problem-solving; and 4) technical skills and knowledge enhancement.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Strategic Goal Support:</h4>
                        <p>This connects to the Strengths section of the SWOT, and can help me accomplish my vision by ensuring that my work will be quality and adaptable. This is because through developing those skills, I will have gained considerable knowledge of how it is done and from there, I can expand upon areas that may need further development or revisions. By doing this, I will also become able to scale up or scale down operations, and change as needed when faced with new or different contexts. Additionally, this connects to the Opportunities section of the SWOT, and can help me accomplish my vision by forming strategic relationships and gain industry intelligence. From this, I will be kept in the loop on news and developments in the industry, as well as enriching knowledge of current systems. Additionally, my reputation will also be bolstered, helping me to eventually reach and accomplish leadership roles and goals in data management and enterprise resource planning. Finally, this connects to the Weaknesses section of the SWOT, and can help me accomplish my vision by ensuring I meet and fulfill industry expectations of me within data management. By doing this, I will also increase chances of me beginning my journey with a strong and positive impact. It will also make me a more endearing candidate to hire, thus helping me to build myself up.</p>

                        <h4>Professional Value:</h4>
                        <p>This will benefit my career by serving as portfolio enhancement (I previously had no portfolio), as well as an applicable project to demonstrate my skills and aptitude for my resume and work letters. Additionally, I will unlock networking opportunities by first establishing key relationships with experienced people in the industry, wherein mentoring opportunities and chances for professional growth can be more easily pursued. Additionally, I will have gained a working professional certificate - CompTIA A+ - that will not have to be renewed for a few years, and demonstrates that I have met the base standards of knowledge to have within the industry.</p>

                        <p>I will receive enhancements to my problem solving skills, since this entire project is dedicated around identifying a problem, devising solutions, and applying those solutions in smaller, more dynamic and specific modules and sections. Additionally, I will gain personal satisfaction since once I complete this project, I will realize it is a larger project and be proud of myself for managing to stick it out and do the best work that I could.</p>

Additionally, I will gain project management experience and training, since this entire project is centered around such. Furthermore, I will improve on my technical skills, since I have to create a viewable and professional database, a fully functional and interactable website with HTML, and a report on what resources I used and their value.</p>

                        This section documents the chosen project methodology based on requirements assessment and delivery needs.

                        <h3>Selected Methodology: Predictive Development Approach</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Methodology Justification:</h4>
                        <p>I chose the predictive methodology because: 1) I have already set requirements for the deliverables and how/what must be done; 2) have already stated in a previous submitted assignment of Deliverables how I will turn in all in at the same time; 3) I already have identified and planned for risks early on; and 4) I plan to document everything related to my journey in this project extensively, in due part to several of my deliverables requiring specific dates and details about personal involvement and application of relevant data and sources used.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Requirements Assessment:</h4>
                        <p>My requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change, given that they are already being taken underway and would be difficult to adjust and complete with remaining time left in semester. There is not much uncertainty in my project, so it would not fit the Hybrid model. Additionally, while some of my work needs feedback and subsequent reiterations (e.g., report), most of it doesn't, so it would not fit the Adaptive model.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Delivery Approach:</h4>
                        <p>I will deliver once at the end, because a majority, if not all, of the deliverables will be viewable and accessible on my personal HTML website. If not on the website, it will be presented separately but also at the same time as the website. Multiple releases would not work, since the deliverables themselves are reliant on the other one being completed for proper quality and accuracy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Project Phases:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Initiate:</strong> Feasibility assessment and risk evaluation</li>
                            <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Design potential sources, professionals to contact, schedule, and materials</li>
                            <li><strong>Execute:</strong> Achieve CompTIA A+ Certificate, interview IT professionals, write report on used resources, create database about professional network, include it in website</li>
                            <li><strong>Test:</strong> Quality assurance and validation</li>
                            <li><strong>Deploy:</strong> Release final website and deliverables</li>
                            <li><strong>Close:</strong> Project presentation and documentation</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>This diagram represents my chosen methodology of Predictive because: 1) it has extensive upfront planning; 2) single delivery in that it will all be delivered at the same time (Week 11 or 12); 3) extensive Documentation being indicated in all the weeks from planning and throughout execution for various deliverables; 4) requirements are clearly specified and not changed after initial definition.</p>
